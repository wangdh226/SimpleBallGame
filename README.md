# SimpleBallGame
Recreating CodelessGame2 from scratch(without the original tutorial) + other features/challenges(with other tutorials). 
Also with repository set up beforehand lmao

Also practicing what I'd like to think is decent version control branching and stuff?

My goal is to practice building workable file structures in Unity, focusing on using scripts to manage the game, and testing out different ways to implement features.

Major things I learned - 
  Prefabs are amazing, though sometimes you have to play around with them to get them to work.
    They are very helpful for when you find a better way to do something and need to replace said thing throughout several scenes...
  I'm still not super clear on Rigidbody interactions - 0 mass rigidbodies don't really count
  Not clear what 'Industry standard' is with regards to using public fields + linking in inspector VS using public methods + calling via C#
  Figured out some animation/animator stuff
