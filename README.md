# SimpleBallGame
Recreating CodelessGame2 from scratch without the tutorial + other features/challenges. 
Also with repository set up beforehand lmao

Also practicing what I'd like to think is decent version control branching and stuff?

My goal is to practice building workable file structures in Unity, focusing on using scripts to manage the game, and testing out different ways to implement features.
